    "Description": "For some odd reason, I can run this program just fine in full-screen, but when I want to run it in Windowed mode, the DOSBox displays a completely green window. I checked DOSBox by launching it alone, and it runs just fine, so it seems that Turbco C++ is somehow utilizing it incorrectly.\r\n\r\nOS: Windows 10 64-bit\r\nProgram OS: 64-bit",
