I came across some files with extension .mnu which I assume contains &quot;menu&quot; options. When I try to open the file in Notepad or Notepad++ I see some text but with many ASCII characters also. Opening in binary format shows signature starting with spaces followed MEN$. How do I read this file?\r<br />\n<br />\nI assume the code might have been developed with Turbo C long back but I am not sure.\r<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nRegards\r<br />\nNijaguna<br />\n",
