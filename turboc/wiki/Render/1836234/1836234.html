<h2><strong>Modulus Operator</strong></h2>
<p>Take a simple arithmetic problem: what's left over when you divide 11 by 3? The answer is easy to compute: divide 11 by 3 and take the remainder: 2. But how would you compute this in a programming language like C or C&#43;&#43;? It's not hard to come up with a formula,
 but the language provides a built-in mechanism, the&nbsp;<strong>modulus operator</strong>&nbsp;('<strong>%</strong>'), that computes the remainder that results from performing integer division.</p>
<p><br>
The modulus operator is useful in a variety of circumstances. It is commonly used to take a randomly generated number and reduce that number to a random number on a smaller range, and it can also quickly tell you if one number is a factor of another.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
If you wanted to know if a number was odd or even, you could use modulus to quickly tell you by asking for the remainder of the number when divided by 2.</p>
<pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int num;
    cin &gt;&gt; num;
    // num % 2 computes the remainder when num is divided by 2
    if ( num % 2 == 0 )
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; num &lt;&lt; &quot; is even &quot;;
    }

    return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>The key line is the one that performs the modulus operation: &quot;num % 2 == 0&quot;. A number is even if and only if it is divisible by two, and a number is divisible by another only if there is no remainder.&nbsp;</p>
